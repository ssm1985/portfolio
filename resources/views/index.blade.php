                <p>A really genuine guy. By far the most impressive guy you could meet. His qualities consist of being intelligent, clever, <span>aggressive</span>, creative, and loving. Spencer knows how to compose a hell of a <span>song</span> website, and shreds on his <span>guitar</span> keyboard like it's the last thing he'll do. Don't be surprised if you see him on tv one day. Did I mention he's a sexy son of a gun? Roughly around 6ft tall, with a built body.</p>
