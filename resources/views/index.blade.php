                  <li>With a Web Developer Certification from SAIT (2018) & BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Calgary (2015), Spencer is a well rounded individual looking to use his skills to master Web Development.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Completed a four month internship with a digital advertising technology company, <a href="https://www.eltoro.com">El Toro</a> in Louisville, KY, USA. Spencer had to work independently to solve issues or implement new features - but with a highly advanced support team ready to assist if needed.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Spencer does not take a typical approach to a portfolio site or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-mcleod">LinkedIn profile</a>. He wants to give you a sense of who he is as a person. He tends to thrive in smaller business environments and company cultures where displaying a sense of personality is valued just as much as learning & a job well done.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Full Stack opportunities are preferred.</li>
